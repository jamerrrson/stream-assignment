</aside>
<p>	The streaming service technology was not invented by one set group, rather a culmination of various companies technological advancements. The first documented commercial streaming product was “StarWorks” (1992), which allowed for ‘on-demand’ MPEG-1 videos to be streamed via ethernet services. The creation of streaming products were created for the sole purpose of multishare video streaming for anyone with direct access to these streaming services.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media">[1]</a>Nine-teen years ago, China-based Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) launched the world’s first video-on-demand service, as part of a wider interactive television (iTV) service.

<h2>What groups are responsible for managing them?</h2>

<h2>Predicting the future of Streaming Services</h2>
<p>	From its birth in the early 1990’s, and the creation of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, Stan, Binge, and various video-game streaming services such as Twitch and Youtube- the industry has boomed. According to SurveyMonkey, roughly 27% of participants in their survey aged 18-29 prefer streaming services. This is in comparison to the 16% who solely prefer broadcast Television; the rest watch both.<a href = "https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/how-do-consumers-feel-about-streaming-services-vs-cable/">[3]</a> Due to this boom, and the rapid decline in popularity of Broadcast television, there will be a time in which the majority of news and television will be consumed via streaming services.

<h2>What are related technologies?</h2>
<p>Related technologies is something such as Youtube which is a streaming service, however, the content that is uploaded onto the website is not studio quality films or TV shows.
